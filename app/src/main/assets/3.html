<h3><span style="color:#c0392b"><strong>History &amp; description</strong></span></h3>

<p>Al Janoub Stadium, also known as Al Wakrah Stadium, is a recently opened new stadium in the town of Al Wakrah that was built to serve as one of the playing venues of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/tournaments/fifa-world-cup-2022-stadiums-qatar/">2022 World Cup</a>&nbsp;in Qatar.</p>

<p>The stadium was part of Qatar&rsquo;s bid to host the World Cup, and in 2013 definite plans were presented. First preparations to make the site ready for construction were started in 2014, but it took until 2016 for proper construction works to commence.</p>

<p>The stadium was scheduled to be completed in the last quarter of 2018, but some delays pushed that back to 2019. Al Janoub Stadium officially opened on 16 May 2019 with a match between Al-Duhail and Al-Sadd (4-1).</p>

<p>Al Janoub Stadium has been designed by&nbsp;<a href="http://zaha-hadid.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zaha Hadid Architects</a>. Its design was inspired by the hulls of the traditional dhow pearl fishing boats, further reflected by the use of timber and traditional materials. The symmetrical roof composed of three shells is the standout feature. Following the release of the designs, people soon starting noting the resemblance of the roof to female genitalia, but Zaha Hadid denied any comparisons.</p>

<p>The stadium is eligible to host World Cup matches up to the quarter-final. After the tournament, the stadium will be scaled down by removing the second tier to a capacity of 20,000 seats.</p>
