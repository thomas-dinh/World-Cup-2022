<h3><strong><span style="color:#c0392b">History and description</span></strong></h3>

<p>Khalifa International Stadium has been Qatar&rsquo;s principal football stadium since 1976. The stadium was built to serve as the flagship venue for the 1976 Gulf Cup that was held in Qatar and could initially hold 20,000 spectators.</p>

<p>Over the years, the stadium has been upgraded several times, most notably for the 2006 Asian Games, which increased capacity to 40,000 seats.</p>

<p>In 2011, Khalifa International Stadium hosted multiple matches including the final between Japan and Australia (1-0) during the 2011 Asian Cup.</p>

<p>Khalifa International Stadium has been the standard playing venue of the Qatar national team and has furthermore occasionally hosted international friendlies of other teams such as Argentina and Brazil.</p>

<p>When Qatar got awarded the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/tournaments/fifa-world-cup-2022-stadiums-qatar/">2022 World Cup</a>&nbsp;in 2010, Khalifa International Stadium was naturally proposed&nbsp;as one of the playing venues, though an extensive upgrade was needed.</p>

<p>Works on the stadium started in 2014, and included a refurbishment of all stands, additional seating, additional hospitality facilities, and the construction of a large innovative roof membrane that covers 70% of the stadium. The iconic arch of the stadium was replaced with a new one and complemented with a second one.</p>

<p>Works were completed in the summer of 2017, which made it the first 2022 World Cup stadium to be finished.</p>

<p>In 2019, Khalifa International Stadium was the venue of the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Athletics.</p>
