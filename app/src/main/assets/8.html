<h3><span style="color:#c0392b"><strong>History and description</strong></span></h3>

<p>Al Thumama Stadium is one of the newly built stadiums for the FIFA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/tournaments/fifa-world-cup-2022-stadiums-qatar/">World Cup 2022</a>&nbsp;in Qatar.</p>

<p>Construction of the stadium began in 2017 and took over four years. Al Thumama Stadium officially opened on 22 October 2021 with the 49th Amir Cup Final between Al-Sadd and Al-Rayyan (1-1).</p>

<p>The stadium&rsquo;s circular design has been inspired by the gahfiya, the traditional woven cap that is commonly worn by men across the Middle East.</p>

<p>During the World Cup, Al Thumama Stadium will host five first round group matches, one round of 16 match, and one quarter-final. The stadium is also one of the playing venues of the 2021 Arab Cup.</p>

<p>After the World Cup, capacity will be reduced to 20,000 seats by removing the upper tier.</p>
