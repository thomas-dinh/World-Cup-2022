<h3><span style="color:#c0392b"><strong>History and description</strong></span></h3>

<p>Education City Stadium, also known as Qatar Foundation Stadium, is one of the playing venues of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/tournaments/fifa-world-cup-2022-stadiums-qatar/">2022 World Cup</a>&nbsp;that will be held in Qatar. It opened in 2020, the third World Cup stadium to be completed.</p>

<p>Plans for the stadium were presented as part of Qatar&rsquo;s bid for the World Cup. Ground preparation works were started in 2014, but it took until the end of 2016 for actual foundation works to start. The stadium was first expected to be completed in 2019, which got delayed to 2020. It officially opened on 15 June 2020 with a special TV program to celebrate the opening. The first match was played over a month later on the 3rd of September.</p>

<p>Education City Stadium is designed to reflect a diamond in the desert. The stadium will have a capacity of roughly 40,000 seats. After the tournament, the capacity will be reduced in half to 20,000 seats.</p>

<p>During the 2022 World Cup, the stadium will host 5 first round group matches, one round of 16 match, and one quarter-final.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Education City Stadium was one of the two venues of the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, which due to the Covid-19 pandemic was played in early 2021. It, among others, hosted the final between Bayern Munich and Tigres UANL (1-0).</p>
