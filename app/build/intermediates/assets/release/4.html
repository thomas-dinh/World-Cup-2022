<h3><strong><span style="color:#c0392b">History and description</span></strong></h3>

<p>Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, also known as Al Rayyan Stadium, is one of the playing venues of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. It opened in 2020.</p>

<p>The stadium was built in place of the old Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, home of Al Rayyan SC. Initially the plan was to expand and renovate the existing stadium, but in the end they built a whole new stadium altogether.</p>

<p>The last match in the old stadium was played in 2014, following which it got demolished and preparation works for the new stadium started. The final designs were presented in 2015, and foundation works started in late 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium officially opened on 18 December 2020 with the Amir Cup Final between Al-Sadd and Al-Arabi (2-1). A few months later the stadium was one of the two venues, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/qatar-foundation-stadium/">Education City Stadium</a>, of the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup that was played in early 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It hosted among others one of the two semi-finals.</p>

<p>For the World Cup the stadium will have a capacity of roughly 40,000 seats. After the World Cup, nearly half of those will be removed again, resulting in a capacity of 21,000.</p>

<p>Its standout feature is the facade that incorporates various symbols of Qatari culture and is inspired by the sand dunes of the nearby desert.</p>

<p>During the World Cup, the stadium is set to host five first round group matches and one round of 16 match.</p>
