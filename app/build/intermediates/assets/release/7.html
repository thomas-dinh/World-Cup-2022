<h3><span style="color:#c0392b"><strong>History &amp; description</strong></span></h3>

<p>Stadium 974, earlier known as Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, is one of the newly built playing venues of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stadiumguide.com/tournaments/fifa-world-cup-2022-stadiums-qatar/">2022 World Cup</a>.</p>

<p>Construction of the stadium started in 2018 and was completed three years later. The stadium officially opened on 30 November 2021 with the Arab Cup group match between United Arab Emirates and Syria (2-1).</p>

<p>The stadium is made of modular building blocks including shipping containers. After the World Cup, it will be entirely dismantled and repurposed.</p>

<p>During the World Cup, Stadium 974 will host 5 first round group matches and of round of 16 match.</p>

<p>It received its name from the fact that 974 is the international calling code of Qatar and as well as that 974 shipping containers were used in the design.</p>
